            <h2>Sterwart Named one of the 100 most influencial people</h2>
            <hr>
              <p>
                In 2003, Stewart co-founded Flickr, one of the pioneers of image sharing and the social web. As CEO, he built Flickr into one of the largest web services in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2013, Stewart and his team launched Slack, which has transformed business communication. Today, Slack is the leading channel-based messaging platform, used by millions to align their teams, unify their systems, and drive their businesses forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stewart has been regularly recognized for the foresight and innovation that has helped him build two companies that have reimagined the way we use technology to communicate, collaborate, share, and store information. He was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by Time Magazine, and one of the Top 50 Leaders by BusinessWeek

            <p>
              It can be difficult to reconcile the elements of Butterfield’s wonky, 
              ivory tower past with his go-go, Silicon Valley present. Here’s a man who dedicated years of his 
              life to head-in-clouds academic pursuits. Yet now he builds practical tools to enhance the brute 
              productivity of the corporate world. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Likewise, you might be surprised to learn that Butterfield 
              was born to countercultural parents who named him Dharma Jeremy Butterfield—before he renamed himself
              Stewart at age 12 because it was the least weird name he could think of. He spent his earliest youth
                in a log cabin in western Canada with no running water, phone or electricity. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The nearest other child lived miles away. Yet now he harnesses sleek, cutting-edge technology 
                in the service of better connecting people who sit at adjacent desks.
